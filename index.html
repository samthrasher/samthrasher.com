    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>I'm Sam Thrasher, a software engineer and AI nerd in San Francisco.
      I initialized my first neural network about a year ago and it's all been downhill from there.
      This is my website, where I shamelessly promote myself and my puns.
      There's not much here yet, so for now just enjoy the web-1.0 goodness.</p>
